To start run the "Start.bat" program.

The resources such as config, the installed jdks and project paths are in the "resources" folder.

The template folder has a bat inside that runs the Main.java in the src folder of the project folder.

If you have problem running the Start bat unzip both zip files in the installed jdks, creating one folder called jdk-21.

Otherwise download the jdk compressed archive here --> https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows

then you can rename the Project folder "Template" into any name.

Folder structure:

[EzJavaCompiler]
|
|__[resources]
|    |
|    |_[Inst-jdks]
|    |
|    |_paths.txt
|    |
|    |_configs.cfg
|  
|__[Template]
     |
     |_ out/		<-- do not put anything in the out path.
     |
     |_ src/		<-- put the "Main.java" here.
     |
     |_ run.bat	<-- after having wrote everything in N++ or any other ide run this or use the interface.

then it's done.
it will run automatically!

Magicâœ¨

To use one or more libraries external to java

modify the bat file and put the libraries here:

javac -classpath [path lib1];[path lib2];..N (Other part of command)

right after javac.

and the same libs here:

.\out\project;[path lib1];[path lib2];..N Main

right before Main.
