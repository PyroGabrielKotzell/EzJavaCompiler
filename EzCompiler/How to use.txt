The template folder has a bat inside that runs the Main.java in the src folder of the project folder

First unzip both zip files in this folder, creating one folder called jdk-21.

Otherwise download the jdk compressed archive here --> https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows

then you can rename the Project folder "Template" into any name.

If you want more Projects just copy the "Template" folder.

Folder structure:

[Project]
|
|_ out/		<-- do not put anything in the out path
|
|_ src/		<-- put the "Main.java" here
|
|_ run.bat		<-- after having wrote everything in N++ or any other ide run this

then it's done.
it will run automatically!

Magicâœ¨

To use one or more libraries external to java

modify the bat file and put the libraries here:

javac -classpath [path lib1];[path lib2];..N (Other part of command)

right after javac.

and the same libs here:

.\out\project;[path lib1];[path lib2];..N Main

right before Main.
